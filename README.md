Anonymize Production International Services data in Development

sunapsis is the nation's most popular international case management software for a good reason: 
Our features and support are the best. 
That's what happens when a university develops software specifically for other universities.

We had an problem where the Center for Global Engagement wanted to be able to test Production Data
in the Development Environment. Doing so without having sensitive information in the Development Database.

With the help of SUNAPSIS Support I wrote this script to Anamolize the Student Data,
after a Restore of Production Data to the development database.

Please Note that I only touch the TABLES that The University of Tennessee use at the moment.
If you add a table I do not touch let me know and I can add it to the script.
